      <description>The Beginning This will be updated once in a while whenever I decide to have a philosophical crisis. Over the course of the past year, the topic of veganism has been of greater interest to me, and I wanted to organize my own thoughts on the subject.
Predicate assumptions of my current beliefs (2022-03-18)
 I have strong beliefs on existentialism, and a positive opinion on utilitarianism All of my positions will be based on the importance of philosophical consistency I don&amp;rsquo;t feel any moral disgust over the consumption of meat I&amp;rsquo;m very much stuck in performative activism in terms of environmental regulations Environmental concerns for humans are the primary reason I&amp;rsquo;m considering this, not animals I&amp;rsquo;m taking it as a given that veganism is good for the environment  I&amp;rsquo;ll be going over several points for/against veganism and trying to justify my positions on each.</description>
