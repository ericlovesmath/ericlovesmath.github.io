      <description>A Background Let&amp;rsquo;s get one thing clear; while as a programmer I find the concept of the blockchain interesting, NFTs are a stain in the environment and our culture of cyclic exploitation.
Although I could discuss thoroughly on my dislike of NFTs, this is not a post on:
 The negative environmental impacts of NFTs The regulation of cryptocurrencies The benefits or harms of the blockchain Proof of Work vs Proof of Stake  Instead, this is a discussion on:</description>

      <title>UC Colleges - 5.5/6 Accepted</title>

      <description>UC College Updates TL;DR Waitlisted at UC Berkeley, accepted to all other UCs (UCLA, Irvine, San Diego, Santa Barbara, Davis).
Its not brilliant news, since Berkeley was most likely the only one I would have considered over Caltech, and I was accepted to everything but Berkeley. I heard from peers that UCLA and UC Berkeley are dichotomies: You either get into one or the other. Unfortunately, that did become true, but it does have one benefit: my application essays were good enough for many of the UCs, so they may be good enough for the 6 colleges I have left.</description>

      <title>Veganism: A Philosophical Argument</title>

      <description>The Beginning This will be updated once in a while whenever I decide to have a philosophical crisis. Over the course of the past year, the topic of veganism has been of greater interest to me, and I wanted to organize my own thoughts on the subject.
Predicate assumptions of my current beliefs (2022-03-18)
 I have strong beliefs on existentialism, and a positive opinion on utilitarianism All of my positions will be based on the importance of philosophical consistency I don&amp;rsquo;t feel any moral disgust over the consumption of meat I&amp;rsquo;m very much stuck in performative activism in terms of environmental regulations Environmental concerns for humans are the primary reason I&amp;rsquo;m considering this, not animals I&amp;rsquo;m taking it as a given that veganism is good for the environment  I&amp;rsquo;ll be going over several points for/against veganism and trying to justify my positions on each.</description>

      <title>MIT College Results, Thoughts on Caltech</title>

      <description>College Results; Post-MIT and Thoughts on Caltech My early acceptance into Caltech has made me significantly calmer when opening my college decisions. I was never particularity enthusiastic about schools like Purdue, UIUC, and UMichigan, but I&amp;rsquo;m certain I would have taken my MIT rejection much worse had I not been accepted into Caltech.
This brings my current list of rejected schools to 2: UChicago and MIT. I&amp;rsquo;d say that considering I&amp;rsquo;ve been accepted to 6/8 schools so far, including some notable ones, I have a decent chance at getting more acceptances when UC and Ivy day comes up.</description>
