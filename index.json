[{"content":"A Background Let\u0026rsquo;s get one thing clear; while as a programmer I find the concept of the blockchain interesting, NFTs are a stain in the environment and our culture of cyclic exploitation.\nAlthough I could discuss thoroughly on my dislike of NFTs, this is not a post on:\n The negative environmental impacts of NFTs The regulation of cryptocurrencies The benefits or harms of the blockchain Proof of Work vs Proof of Stake  Instead, this is a discussion on:\n Whether or not NFTs have had a positive or negative impact on Art Whether or not NFTs should be considered art  What is an NFT? Note: This will be an heavily simplified explanation, as this post is focused on the art aspect rather than the technical\nNFT stands for Non-fungible token\n Fungible: Able to replace or be replaced by another identical item; mutually interchangeable.\n To put it simply \u0026ldquo;Non-fungible\u0026rdquo; is anything that has a unique value to it that isn\u0026rsquo;t replicable, whether that\u0026rsquo;s a collector\u0026rsquo;s edition Pokemon card or an original Van Gogh painting. Typically, a large part of its value comes from the fact that it is unique, rather than its pure utility.\nNFTs also have those same traits as Pokemon cards and Van Gogh paintings, except they\u0026rsquo;re stored on the blockchain. For the purposes of this article, all you have to know about the blockchain is that you can imagine it as series of groups of people checking that the object on the blockchain is real, and passing it on to the next group of people, and so on. Essentially, it artificially creates the scarcity and uniqueness given to NFTs. The NFTs itself are typically in the form of images or videos, which are bought and sold over the blockchain, much like how people trade old baseball cards or coins for a high price.\nThe process of checking these NFTs is environmentally taxing as well as can be used as a form of money laundering, but this post will only argue against one common argument: \u0026ldquo;NFTs are the future of art\u0026rdquo;\nThe NFT Argument over Art Comparison to Digital Art Many in support of NFTs compare it to digital art. After all, a vast amount of NFTs are photos or videos of traditional forms of artwork, or even just works of digital art sold as an NFT. Why should the NFT be seen as less legitimate than such forms of media?\nThe use of art as artificially inflated sources of money laundering isn\u0026rsquo;t a new concept, so why should this criticism be made with NFTs?\nAfter all, isn\u0026rsquo;t the value of art subjective?\nThe Value of Digital Art vs. NFTs Its important to recognize that while only some of the art world is surrounded by such controversy, it is almost all of NFTs that are used for the purpose of profit. In fact, I would argue that it is the goal of most NFTs minted today. Low quality and easily generated NFTs are minted every day with the expectation that another buyer will spend a higher price on that NFT, creating one of the largest market bubbles ever seen. The value of the NFTs doesn\u0026rsquo;t come out of an appreciation of the art itself, but rather for the expectation of profit.\nDigital art is almost always commissioned. This means that an individual who recognizes the talent of the artist will pay the artist upfront for their labor, and be given the rights to use the image. This is different from NFTs where the image itself could have been replaced by anything else, and it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t matter because the value is the concept of owning one rather than legally owning a particular image. If profit is the only motive, the art itself is irrelevant.\nNFTs are usually created through generative methods, which means its typically created through the use of a computer program. This does not mean that it is valueless, as plenty of digital artists create generative art to sell as prints or digital products like wallpapers. However, the world of NFTs has diluted generative art into simple program that can mass produce millions of randomized works that hopefully will sell at an absurd price. It\u0026rsquo;s a slap in the face to artists who use generative art to create the one particular result that they desire.\nMany digital artists have now found themselves in a position where using NFTs is the only way to make their ventures profitable, and its being used by pundits to justify the use of NFTs. NFTs are nothing more than the newest beanie baby; no inherit value with a bubble waiting to pop.\n","permalink":"https://ericlovesmath.github.io/blog/nft_bad/","title":"No, NFTs aren't good for Art either"},{"content":"UC College Updates TL;DR Waitlisted at UC Berkeley, accepted to all other UCs (UCLA, Irvine, San Diego, Santa Barbara, Davis).\nIts not brilliant news, since Berkeley was most likely the only one I would have considered over Caltech, and I was accepted to everything but Berkeley. I heard from peers that UCLA and UC Berkeley are dichotomies: You either get into one or the other. Unfortunately, that did become true, but it does have one benefit: my application essays were good enough for many of the UCs, so they may be good enough for the 6 colleges I have left.\nHonestly I just wanted that \u0026ldquo;6/6 UCs accepted\u0026rdquo;.\nTwo of my friends who were very stressed about their various rejections on their UCs were accepted into UC Berkeley though, so cheers to them!\nUSC and Carnegie Mellon will be released in the following two days, and I hope for the best.\nCollege: Accepted  Caltech University of Michigan Purdue, UIUC UCLA, UCI, UCSD, UCSB, UC Davis  College: Waitlisted  UC Berkeley  College: Rejected  MIT University of Chicago  College: Waiting  Stanford, Princeton, Carnegie Mellon Yale, Cornell, USC  ","permalink":"https://ericlovesmath.github.io/blog/uc_updates/","title":"UC Colleges - 5.5/6 Accepted"},{"content":"The Beginning This will be updated once in a while whenever I decide to have a philosophical crisis. Over the course of the past year, the topic of veganism has been of greater interest to me, and I wanted to organize my own thoughts on the subject.\nPredicate assumptions of my current beliefs (2022-03-18)\n I have strong beliefs on existentialism, and a positive opinion on utilitarianism All of my positions will be based on the importance of philosophical consistency I don\u0026rsquo;t feel any moral disgust over the consumption of meat I\u0026rsquo;m very much stuck in performative activism in terms of environmental regulations Environmental concerns for humans are the primary reason I\u0026rsquo;m considering this, not animals I\u0026rsquo;m taking it as a given that veganism is good for the environment  I\u0026rsquo;ll be going over several points for/against veganism and trying to justify my positions on each.\n\u0026ldquo;The Dividing Line\u0026rdquo; doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist To make this point, I need to diverge temporarily away from the main point to talk about something else entirely: Trans rights.\nTrans Rights: \u0026ldquo;What is the definition of a ___\u0026rdquo;? I\u0026rsquo;m for trans rights. One of the most common essentialist rhetoric that I see from transphobes is that there is a biological set definition that delineates between a woman and a man, and at this point I\u0026rsquo;ve heard it so much that I have a set response for it: What exactly is that dividing line?\nCommon responses and my refutations to them:\n \u0026ldquo;Chromosomes\u0026rdquo;: We know cis women with XY chromosomes, or cis men with XXY chromosomes (Klienfelter\u0026rsquo;s syndrome). Additionally, since we didn\u0026rsquo;t even know chromosomes existed until 1882, we had to have some definition before 1882 that didn\u0026rsquo;t use chromosomes. \u0026ldquo;Ability to give birth\u0026rdquo;: This would make infertile women be a cis man \u0026ldquo;Genitals\u0026rdquo;: This would imply those without genitals (MRKH Syndrom) wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have a gender. Or sex, for that matter. \u0026ldquo;These are all exceptions\u0026rdquo;: In that case, I can say that people with green eyes are \u0026ldquo;exceptions\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t actually exist\u0026rdquo;, because there are less people with green eyes than trans people. This also doesn\u0026rsquo;t answer why one would see the other exceptions as valid, but not this.  The point is there is no dividing line. I support the definition of \u0026ldquo;a woman\u0026rdquo; as \u0026ldquo;someone who identifies as one\u0026rdquo;. This does create a proper diving line, but says nothing about the qualities of someone who would identifies as a woman, which is why I don\u0026rsquo;t like social construct of gender as a whole. But this definition serves better than the biological or essentialist definitions used by transphobes today.\nBack to the dividing line on veganism So why did I talk about trans rights? Well to be philosophical consistent, I have to ask the same question about any groups of people; its the same line of reasoning I can use to justify that very basic concept of \u0026ldquo;not being racist\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;not being sexist\u0026rdquo;. Of course I don\u0026rsquo;t need that much thought to say that, but I think it serves as a useful tool.\nBut I\u0026rsquo;ve never asked that outside of the window of just human beings. Which makes me ask\u0026hellip;\nWhat is the dividing line between humans and animals? To expand on that question, why should that dividing line be able to justify mistreatment of animals? What makes humans so much inherently better that allows me to not consider the lives of animals have enough value?\nReasons I gave to myself, and my problems with them:\n \u0026ldquo;Out of a necessity to live\u0026rdquo;: I can live perfectly fine without meat. This is a different story if I\u0026rsquo;m in a region where I\u0026rsquo;m starving, but this is definitely not a valid reason for me. \u0026ldquo;Intelligence\u0026rdquo;: I still ascribe value to those that are human vegetables, or brain dead, or those that are profoundly mentally disabled to the point where they would probably have less intelligence than the average dog or pig. Speaking of dogs and pigs, I eat pigs but not dogs, which makes this point weird since they have similar levels of intelligence. \u0026ldquo;Capacity to feel pain\u0026rdquo;: Again, this makes it more justified for me to eat a human vegetable than a pig. Also, the average person wouldn\u0026rsquo;t eat their pet, even after they die painlessly. \u0026ldquo;Its just how it is, culturally and historically\u0026rdquo;: You could justify lots of things this way: slavery, misogyny, war, etc. I\u0026rsquo;ve never been a fan of conservatism for this reason. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re genetically superior; its just Darwin at play\u0026rdquo;: We\u0026rsquo;ve justified misogyny through this exact principle. This rhetoric is just a more milder form of race realism to me, just with species.  In short, I can\u0026rsquo;t seem to find that philosophically consistent dividing line, nor can I justify that difference. But in thinking about the first point, I found a bigger issue with my analysis.\nThe dividing line isn\u0026rsquo;t about humans vs animals, its about humans taste vs animals I\u0026rsquo;m not starving here. I can live without them. The choice I\u0026rsquo;m making here isn\u0026rsquo;t my own survival compared to an animals, its my choice for pleasure on my taste buds compared to an animal\u0026rsquo;s life. And yes, I\u0026rsquo;m taking it as a given that animals taste good, which is why I\u0026rsquo;m debating this at all in the first place.\nPutting it like that, it makes the points I\u0026rsquo;ve made almost worthless. No, I don\u0026rsquo;t value animal lives over human pleasure. If someone wanted to kill a pig because they like the sounds it makes, I would be repulsed. But really, what\u0026rsquo;s the difference between doing that for taste and sound?\nThis begs the question: What\u0026rsquo;s the dividing line between animals and plants? This is where I\u0026rsquo;m stuck for now. This feels like it leads to an infinite regress, but then again, as I established in the last point, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t really matter when it comes to the topic of veganism.\nMoreover, we grow plants, feed them to animals, then we eat the animals. Vegans just eat the plants. In that sense, we are causing the exact same amount of harm to plants, so this is a non-issue to me.\n","permalink":"https://ericlovesmath.github.io/blog/veganism_dividing_line/","title":"Veganism: A Philosophical Argument"},{"content":"College Results; Post-MIT and Thoughts on Caltech My early acceptance into Caltech has made me significantly calmer when opening my college decisions. I was never particularity enthusiastic about schools like Purdue, UIUC, and UMichigan, but I\u0026rsquo;m certain I would have taken my MIT rejection much worse had I not been accepted into Caltech.\nThis brings my current list of rejected schools to 2: UChicago and MIT. I\u0026rsquo;d say that considering I\u0026rsquo;ve been accepted to 6/8 schools so far, including some notable ones, I have a decent chance at getting more acceptances when UC and Ivy day comes up. However, I don\u0026rsquo;t believe that I\u0026rsquo;ll be accepting a school other than Caltech.\nCaltech is significantly different from some of the other schools that I applied to in the sense that it leans towards academia more than anyone else. I\u0026rsquo;m extremely torn whether I want to enter industry or academia related work, but either way I feel like there\u0026rsquo;s some risk to Caltech funneling me into one mentality just by the nature in which the classes are built. The computer science program at Caltech specifically isn\u0026rsquo;t extremely famous, but it is the most popular track, which I wonder how research will faire in that field. Allegedly, the CS department has plans to expand its funding, and I\u0026rsquo;m excited to see what research opportunities will be available. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how I feel about research at NASA, but its good that I know that non-industry internships are always available there.\nWhatever the case, college isn\u0026rsquo;t supposed to be the \u0026ldquo;end-all-be-all\u0026rdquo;, and I hope it all works out in the end.\nCollege: Accepted  Caltech, University of Michigan Purdue, UIUC, UCI, UC Davis  College: Rejected  University of Chicago, MIT  College: Waiting  Stanford, Princeton, Carnegie Mellon Yale, Cornell, UC Berkeley USC, UCLA, UCSD, UCSB  ","permalink":"https://ericlovesmath.github.io/blog/college_results_mit/","title":"MIT College Results, Thoughts on Caltech"}]
